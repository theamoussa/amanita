<b>Adam Alessi</b> (b. 1994, Los Angeles, CA) is a self-taught artist living and working in New York. His work blends figuration with surreal, cinematic imagery—featuring uncanny characters rendered in dusky, textural fields that evoke dream states, nostalgia, and private mythologies. Recent solo exhibitions include <em>Fields</em> at Barbati Gallery (Venice, 2024); <em>The Village</em> at CLEARING (New York, 2023); and <em>Cruiser’s Creek</em> at CLEARING (Brussels, 2022). Alessi’s work has also been shown at Morán Morán (Los Angeles), Smart Objects (Los Angeles), Mascota (Mexico City), Lo Brutto Stahl (Paris) and Public Gallery (London).
<br><br><b>Tina Braegger</b> (b. 1985, Switzerland) lives and works in Zurich. Her practice centers on the Grateful Dead’s “dancing bear” mascot, which she appropriates through painting to interrogate themes of subculture, mass reproduction, and the mythology of Americana. Recent solo exhibitions include Le Consortium, Dijon (2024); Tif Sigfrids, New York (2023); and House of Gaga, Mexico City (2022). Group exhibitions include Swiss Institute, New York (2023); Palais de Tokyo, Paris (2021); and Kunsthalle Zürich, Zurich (2020). She received her MFA from the University of the Arts, Berlin.
<br><br><b>John Hee Taek Chae</b> (b. 1988, Colorado) is an artist and educator whose work explores hybrid visual culture through the practice of painting. He received a BFA from Maryland Institute College of Art (2010) and an MFA in Painting and Printmaking from Virginia Commonwealth University (2020). Solo exhibitions include Hallucination at D.D.D.D. (New York), A Dark and Bloody Ground at Institute 193 (Lexington), Shed Your Eyes at MARCH (New York), and Make. Believe. at MOCA Jacksonville. He is a recipient of the MacDowell Fellowship (2021) and a Yaddo Fellowship (2022) and was the 2023 Cynthia Woods Mitchell Scholar in Residence at the University of Houston. Chae is currently Assistant Professor of Painting and Drawing at Alfred University.
<br><br><b>Gregory Crewdson</b> (b. 1962, Brooklyn, NY) is a photographer whose meticulously staged images examine the psychological landscapes of American life. Using the production methods of cinema—complete with lighting crews, actors, and constructed sets—he creates large-scale photographs that evoke tension, stillness, and narrative ambiguity. Crewdson earned a B.A. from SUNY Purchase in 1985 and an M.F.A. from Yale University in 1988, where he now serves as adjunct professor in Graduate Photography. Crewdson has exhibited widely in the United States and internationally, with work included in the collections of MoMA, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum, LACMA, and SFMOMA. He has exhibited widely in the U.S. and Europe, with retrospectives at institutions such as Kulturhuset in Stockholm and c/o Berlin. Crewdson has received numerous honors, including the Skowhegan Medal for Photography and fellowships from the NEA and the Aaron Siskind Foundation. He lives and works in western Massachusetts.
<br><br><b>Richard Diebenkorn</b> (1922–1993) was a defining voice in postwar American art, known for his movement between abstraction and figuration. Born in Portland, Oregon, and raised in San Francisco, he studied at Stanford and was deeply influenced by artists such as Matisse, Cézanne, and Hopper. After serving in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II, he used the G.I. Bill to attend the California School of Fine Arts, joining a circle of artists who would shape the Bay Area’s modernist legacy.
In the 1980s and early ’90s, Diebenkorn focused on small works on paper from his home in Healdsburg, California. Though increasingly private, his work remained formally inventive and deeply personal. He died in Berkeley in 1993, leaving behind a profoundly influential and distinctly American vision.
<br><br><b>Damien H. Ding</b> (b. 1992) received a BA in Art History from Swarthmore College and an MFA in Painting and Printmaking from the Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts. Recent solo exhibitions include, Precious Mirror (Island Gallery, NY) Simple Structures (Steven Zevitas Gallery, Boston), Private Paintings (Denny Gallery, NY). His work has been included in notable group exhibitions at Linseed Projects (Shanghai, China); Braverman Gallery (Tel Aviv), Eugster (Belgrade, Serbia), Kristin Hjellegjerde Gallery (Schloss Goerne, Germany), Galerie Marguo (Paris, France), Steven Zevitas Gallery (Boston, MA), Alexander Berggruen (NY), Denny Dimin Gallery (Hong Kong), Afternoon Projects (Vancouver, Canada), and Amanita (NY) among others. His work has been featured in publications such as Hyperallergic, The Brooklyn Rail, Whitewall, and Artsy.
<br><br><b>Marcus Jahmal </b>(b. 1990, Brooklyn, NY) is a self-taught painter and sculptor whose work draws from personal history, Creole heritage, and urban experience. His paintings combine figuration, still life, and abstraction, often weaving surreal narratives that reflect on Americana, class, and dreamlike memory. Recent solo exhibitions include Martyrdom at Spazio Sassetti (Florence, 2025); Higher Animals at the Allentown Art Museum (2024); Fragments at Almine Rech (Shanghai, 2024); and Interiors at Anton Kern Gallery (New York, 2023). Jahmal lives and works in New York.
<br><br><b>Neil Jenney</b> (b. 1945, Torrington, CT) is a painter and sculptor known for his “Bad Paintings” of the 1960s–70s, which challenged the aesthetics of minimalism with raw figuration and direct realism. He seeks to revive classical ideals of truth in art, integrating form and content. Recent solo exhibitions include Tobias Mueller Modern Art (Zurich), the Morris Museum (NJ), and the New Britain Museum of American Art (CT). His work is held in collections including the Met, MoMA, Whitney, LACMA, Tate, and Louisiana Museum. Last year, he was featured in a two-person show with Robert Lobe at Venus Over Manhattan.
<br><br><b>Friedrich Kunath</b> (b. 1974, Chemnitz, Germany) is a Los Angeles–based artist whose work blends romanticism and conceptualism, fusing poetic text with melancholic and humorous imagery. Drawing from his migration between Germany and California, Kunath’s visual language references German Romanticism, pop culture, and mass media. Kunath has been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions including <em>Coming Home Was As Beautiful As Going Away</em>, KINDL - Centre for Contemporary Art, Berlin, Germany (2023); There Must Be A Spanish Word For <em>This Feeling</em>, Centro de Arte Contemporáneo de Málaga, Spain (2023); <em>I’ll Try to Be More Romantic</em>, Kunstsammlung Jena, Jena, Germany (2021); <em>Juckreiz</em>, Sammlung Philara, Düsseldorf, Germany (2016); <em>A Plan to Follow Summer Around the World</em>, Centre d'art Contemporain d'Ivry - le Crédac, Ivry-sur-Seine, France (2014); <em>Raymond Moody's Blues</em>, Modern Art Oxford, Oxford, UK (2013); <em>Your Life is Not for You</em>, Sprengel Museum, Hannover, Germany (2012); <em>Lonely Are the Free</em>, Schinkel Pavillon, Berlin, Germany (2011); Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, CA (2010); Kunstsaele, Berlin, Germany (2010). His work is also featured in prominent public and private collections such as the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA; Centre Pompidou, Paris, France; DESTE Foundation for Contemporary Art, Athens, Greece; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, CA; Hessel Museum of Art, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, CA; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, CA; Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, CA; Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY; Pinault Collection, Paris, France; and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN, among many more.
 
<br><br><b>Anders Lindseth</b> (b. 1990, Gates Mills, OH) is a multidisciplinary artist working in painting, drawing, and sculpture.

In 2022, his six-channel video installation Forever and Forever was presented in a vacant space beneath Rockefeller Center.
<br><br><b>Titus McBeath</b> (b. 1997, Findlay, Ohio) graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New York City. Drawing on his working-class roots in the American Midwest, McBeath’s practice explores the intersection of manufacturing and the poetics of consumer culture. His work often takes the form of serial objects that are 3D-printed, hand crafted, or robotic. His work evokes the industrial and agricultural landscapes of his upbringing, where corn and manufacturing dominate the economy. McBeath currently lives and works in New York City. Recent solo exhibitions include Be Back Soon at Will Shot Gallery (New York, 2024) and Wild Fire at Ateliers Courbet (New York, 2024). Recent group exhibitions include October Surprise at Shipton (New York, 2024); We’ll Be Outside and Delivery Included at U-Haul Gallery (New York, 2024); AND/OR at MARQUEE PROJECTS (Bellport, 2024); Whiplash at 191 Henry Street (New York, 2024); Growing Orbits at 24 West 23rd Street (New York, 2023); Christless Tree at Blade Study (New York, 2023); Collage Group at Will Shot Gallery (New York, 2023); and Amelia Tru Harrell × Holly Chang × Titus McBeath at Yiri Arts (Taipei, 2023).

<br><br><b>Kayode Ojo</b> (b. 1990, Cookeville, TN) is a New York–based artist whose multidisciplinary practice spans photography and sculpture, using high-gloss materials – such as mirrors, metal, and fashion articles – to explore the nature of desire, aspiration, and the performance of identity.
Recent solo exhibitions include <em>Me & U</em> at Sweetwater, Berlin (2024); <em>Eden</em> at 52 Walker, New York (2023); Could You Bare Your Torso?, Università Iuav di Venezia, Venice (2022); and <em>Call It What You Want</em> at Sweetwater, Berlin (2021).

<br><br><b>Louis Osmosis</b> (b. 1996, Brooklyn, NY) is an interdisciplinary artist working primarily in sculpture, drawing, performance, and text. His practice revolves heavily around craft/manufacture, performative actions, and readymades, incorporating found objects and vernacular materials from popsicle sticks to graphic t-shirts, and hornet nests to violins. Equally invested in reenactment and artistic production, Osmosis’s speculative approach to form reflects his ongoing “investigation into affected modes of aspiration and lack.” Osmosis received his BFA from the Cooper Union in 2018.

Recent solo exhibitions include Greene Naftali, New York (2024, 2020); The Power Station, Dallas (2023); Mendes Wood DM, São Paulo (2022); Galleria Federico Vavassori, Milan (2021, 2017); Fiorucci Art Trust, London (2021); Mendes Wood DM, Brussels (2019); Riverside, Bern (2018); Warm, São Paulo (2016); and GRGLT, Turin (2015).

<br><br><b>Yves Scherer</b> (b. 1987, Solothurn, Switzerland) is a visual artist based in NewYork City. Working in media spanning from figurative sculpture to oil painting and lenticular prints, he creates immersive environments that combine personal narratives with fan fiction and celebrity culture to offer the viewer an often romantic lens or perspective on the self, relationships and the everyday.

<br><br><b>Joel Sternfeld</b> (b. 1944, New York, NY) is an artist-photographer whose work is concerned with utopic and dystopic possibilities of the American experience.
Since the publication of his landmark study, American Prospects in 1987 his work has maintained conceptual and political aspects, while also being steeped in history, art history, landscape theory and attention to seasonal passage. It is a melancholic, spectacular, funny, and profound portrait of America. All his subsequent work has sought to expand the narrative possibilities of still photography primarily through an authored text. All of his books and bodies of work converse with each other and may be read as a collective whole. Sternfeld is the recipient of two Guggenheim Fellowships and spent a year in Italy on a Rome Prize. He teaches at Sarah Lawrence College.
