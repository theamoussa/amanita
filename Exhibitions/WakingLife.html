      They say dreaming’s dead, that no one does it anymore.<br>
      It’s not dead. It’s just that it’s been forgotten.<br>
      Removed from our language.<br>
      Nobody teaches it, so no one knows it exists.<br>
      The dreamer is banished to obscurity.<br>
      I’m trying to change all that, and I hope you are too.<br>
      By dreaming every day.<br>
      Dreaming with our hands and dreaming with our minds.<br>
      Our planet is facing the greatest problems it’s ever faced.<br>
      So whatever you do, don’t be bored.<br>
      This is absolutely the most exciting time we could have possibly hoped to be alive.<br>
      And things are just starting.<br>

      <b>Bill Jensen</b> (b. 1945, Minneapolis, United States) came into prominence in the late 1970s in New York City. His work was exhibited at the New Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, at the Whitney Museum of American Art including 1981 Whitney Biennial, and the Museum of Modern Art.

      <b>Mercedes Llanos</b> Mercedes Llanos (b.1992, Mar del Plata, Argentina) is a painter, drawer and muralist based in New York City. She graduated with an MFA from CUNY Hunter College in 2021 and is a grantee of The Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation Grant for figurative painting. Her practice deals with the surreal aspect of dreams as they concern waking life issues, mainly focusing on power roles in domestic partnerships embedded in a South American patriarchal upbringing. In her dreams, she subconsciously navigates the repression of freedom firsthand experienced, and that of the transgenerational woman collective. Her works not only show tension between two opposing forces, but also love and care, confusing the viewer as to whether the events portrayed are pleasurable or painful, loving or hateful. Mercedes Llanos has exhibitted at Balice Hertling, Paris; Lyles and King, New York; and the Vergez Collection, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Llanos has a solo show upcoming with Amanita in 2024.

      <b>Mosie Romney</b>(b. 1994, New York, New York) lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Working in the space between figuration and abstraction, their work uses painting as a portal through which to explore themes of self-perception and polychronic time. Recontextualizing images from a multitude of sources including family photo albums found on the internet, movie stills, literature, screen shots, dreams, and an evolving cast of characters continually recycled from previous works, Romney tells stories of empowerment and explores life as a multi-performative experience. Their work is in the permanent collections of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami, FL; Pond Society, Shanghai, China; the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, NY; and the Yuz Museum, Shanghai, China, among others. Romney’s work has been included in exhibitions at White Columns, New York, NY; Nicodim, Bucharest, RO, Los Angeles, CA, and New York, NY; Greene Naftali, New York, NY; Gern en Regalia, New York, NY; Almine Rech, London, UK, and New York, NY; Rachel Uffner Gallery, New York, NY, among others.

      <b>Adrian Schachter</b> (b.1996, New York, New York) is a contemporary visual artist whose works are developed through a sense of idealistic cynicism, moving him to analyze all hypocrisies and inconsistencies encountered. When applied to the world of images, Adrian was bombarded with an online presence since childhood, along with the rest of his generation. There was an appetite for digesting data in every form that was nothing less than voracious. Yet, the more diverse and psychologically charged the information was, the more Adrian became increasingly numbed and detached. Schachter will have a solo exhibition at Amanita in 2024. Schachter lives and works in New York.

      <b>Janaina Tschäpe</b> (b, 1973, Munich, Germany) is a German-Brazilian artist whose multidisciplinary body of work has encompassed painting, drawing, photography, video, and sculpture. Tschäpe’s dreamlike, abstract landscapes blur the line between aquatic, plant, and human forms, referencing not only the landscapes Tschäpe draws upon for inspiration, but also her interest in myth, morphology, and the mysteries of aquatic states. Tchäpe’s work is found in important public collections including Centre Pompidou, Paris, France; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, Spain; Harvard Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Moderna Museet, Stockholm, Sweden; Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary, Vienna, Austria; and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., among others.
